Product design for Reporter: an MVP for Roadmap 2.0.
{: .measure-wide .mt0 }

Roadmap is an <span class="nobreak">enterprise-scale</span> project management tool focused on integrating with existing tools and <span class="nobreak">exception-based</span> management.
{: .measure-wide }

I joined the small team of four to help reimagine Roadmap from the ground up from both a design and technology point of view. After interviewing different types of customers about how they use Roadmap, and about their project workflow. We found what worked and didn't work about the current release of Roadmap. A clearer point of view, better user experience, and more flexible and easily adoptable tool. It became clear that we needed a strategy for slowly rolling out Roadmap 2.0: an MVP of Reporter.

**The goals of Reporter**
<br>
To exist concurrently with Roadmap 1.0, to provide new features to existing customers, and to raise revenue from new customers.

**Ideas & Principles**
{: .measure-wide .ma0 }
- {: .list} Stay flexible
- {: .list} We are not a spreadsheet application
- {: .list} We are not a full featured B.I. tool
- {: .list} We should be used efficiently and effectively
- {: .list} Keep time in Roadmap to a minimum
- {: .list} Set up once and forget
- {: .list} Exceptions based management through generated reports
- {: .list} Integrations: Many tools, one view
- {: .list} Better Support for low-granularity data

**Integrations**
<br>
The primary value of Roadmap is collecting data from a variety of tools (github, trello, jira, ...) into a single view. A customer is often a single administrator or team leader and doesn't have to ask their team to adopt a brand new tool.
{: .measure-wide .mt0 }

**Reports**
<br>
A Report is a structured comparison of hours, workdays, or dollars across projects, people, tasks, or roles. This allows a user to analyze past data, measure progress, and forecast the future, enabling faster, better decisions.

**Base Report**
<br>
Base reports are the core unit of Reporter. The goal is to provide clear and useful information in a flexible way. A base report comes with a primary data set: Planning Efficiency, Utilization, Project Status, Revenue, Collisions, as well as a series of data columns (logged hours, planned hours, etc). A base report has different views: overview, by time, by distribution, can be viewed across different data sets (hours, work-day, budget dollars) and can be navigated across time and time resolution (week, month, ...).

**Hiding information until asked**
<br>
I designed Reporter with the principal that targeted information is better than complete information, as long as there is easy navigation to ask for contextually related data. A row can be expanded to view it's contributing factors (a project expands to see the internal tasks, people, and roles).

**Saved Reports & Filters**
<br>
A base report can be saved with a relative timeframe, optional Filters, custom names, and rolled up widget viz.  Rather than spending time grouping and organizing a large table view each time you open Roadmap for a particular task - Saved Reports allows a single setup and return.

     sizes="(min-width: 2100px) 50vw, (min-width: 700px) 70vw, 100vw" />

**Collections**
<br>
Saved Reports can be sorted into Collections and viewed with a targeted context ("JS weekly meeting"). Using collections gives some amount of context before clickthrough, to “prime” a question that needs answered before clickthrough. Rather than "browsing" data.

**Dashboard & Exceptions**
<br>
1.  Give access to important information, in a way that avoids the need to dig deeper
2.  if digging deeper, provide useful links
The main reason for updating the website was to allow non-technical employees to easily update copy and blog posts. I used this as an opportunity to make improvements across the board to Roadmap’s public face.
color coding exceptions. Roadmap will help Project Managers use their time efficiently
Once reports are saved and filtered in to contextual collections, and exception bounds are chosen, RM can add immense value as a short quick overview each business day. It doesn't have to be a chore or additional baggage. Given data integrations and
Generic stats. Projects, Tasks, People, what was completed, what is late, etc. Saved Report Collections, pages of saved reports with names. Chosen to be shown on the dashboard for a quick overview.
