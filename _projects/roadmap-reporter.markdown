Product design for Reporter: an MVP for Roadmap 2.0.
{: .measure-wide .mt0 }

Roadmap is an <span class="nobreak">enterprise-scale</span> project management tool focused on integrating with existing tools and <span class="nobreak">exception-based</span> management. While Roadmap is in process of rebuilding both from a design and technology point of view, it became clear that we needed a strategy for releasing an MVP.

**The goals of Reporter**
<br>
To exist concurrently with Roadmap 1.0, to provide new features to existing customers, and to raise revenue from new customers.

**Ideas & Principles**
{: .measure-wide .ma0 }
- {: .list} Stay flexible
- {: .list} We are not a spreadsheet application
- {: .list} We are not a full featured B.I. tool
- {: .list} We should be used efficiently and effectively
- {: .list} Keep time in Roadmap to a minimum
- {: .list} Set up once and forget
- {: .list} Exceptions based management through generated reports
- {: .list} Integrations: Many tools, one view
- {: .list} Better Support for low-granularity data

**Integrations**
<br>
The primary value of Roadmap is collecting data from a variety of tools (github, trello, jira, ...) into a single view. A customer is often a single administrator or team leader and doesn't have to ask their team to adopt a brand new tool.

**Reports**
<br>
A Report is a structured comparison of hours, workdays, or dollars across projects, people, tasks, or roles. This allows a user to analyze past data, measure progress, and forecast the future, enabling faster, better decisions.

**Base Report**
<br>
The core unit-
overview, by time, by distribution
examples: Planning Efficiency, Utilization, Project Status, Revenue, Collisions, ...

**Hiding information until asked**
<br>
A row can be expanded to view it's contributing factors ( Projects -> tasks, people, roles) This expanded view should always add up to the same numbers. Sometimes this will require an "Unassigned" role. (ie a project's hours might not all be associated with a role).
Targetted information > complete information (with easy access)

**Saved Reports & Filters**
<br>
optional Filters
relative timeframe
custom names
rolled up widget viz
Rather than spending time grouping and organizing a large table view, Saved Reports allows a single setup and return. Rolled-up card view.

**Collections**
<br>
Saved Reports can be sorted in to Collections and viewed with a targeted context ("JS weekly meeting").
Saved reports are primarily viewed through collections. - to give some amount of context before clickthrough, to “prime” a question that needs answered before clickthrough

**Dashboard & Exceptions**
<br>
1.  Give access to important information, in a way that avoids the need to dig deeper
2.  if digging deeper, provide useful links
The main reason for updating the website was to allow non-technical employees to easily update copy and blog posts. I used this as an opportunity to make improvements across the board to Roadmap’s public face.
color coding exceptions. Roadmap will help Project Managers use their time efficiently
Once reports are saved and filtered in to contextual collections, and exception bounds are chosen, RM can add immense value as a short quick overview each business day. It doesn't have to be a chore or additional baggage. Given data integrations and
Generic stats. Projects, Tasks, People, what was completed, what is late, etc. Saved Report Collections, pages of saved reports with names. Chosen to be shown on the dashboard for a quick overview.
