Product design for Reporter: an MVP for Roadmap 2.0. Roadmap is an <span class="nobreak">enterprise-scale</span> project management tool focused on integrating with existing tools and <span class="nobreak">exception-based</span> management.

**Reports**
<br>
Reports are the central focus. A Report is a comparison across projects, people, tasks, or roles that can be viewed across time. It also allows a natural way to do forecasting and analysis by starting with broad numbers and limited information, but allowing easy access to drill down to more detailed information about problem areas.

**Saved Reports & Filters**
<br>
Rather than spending time grouping and organizing a large table view, Saved Reports allows a single setup and return. Rolled-up card view.

**Collections**
<br>
Saved Reports can be sorted in to Collections and viewed with a targeted context ("JS weekly meeting").

**Dashboard & Exceptions**
<br>
The main reason for updating the website was to allow non-technical employees to easily update copy and blog posts. I used this as an opportunity to make improvements across the board to Roadmapâ€™s public face.
