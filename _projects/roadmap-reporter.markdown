**Ideas & Principles**
<br>
- Exceptions based management and reporting
- Integrations: Many tools, one view
- We aren’t building a spreadsheet application
- We aren’t building a full featured BI tool
- Customers should use Roadmap effeciently and effectively and then get back to their job
- Set up once and forget
- Stay flexible
- Expand accessable markets
