Printed book as an exhibition of Sol LeWitt's work.
{: .measure-wide }

An exhibition catalogue plays the role of indexing the event, providing additional context, information, writing, etc., but I wanted to explore what it would mean for an exhibition catalogue to only be self-referential. It is often said that when art is reproduced it can't have the same experiential qualities as seeing it is person - but what new affordances might open up?

I wanted to provide a structure  to the book that wasn't linear, something more experiential drawing from physical exhibitions or websites. A networked quality - rhyzomatic browsing.

The book includes essays by LeWitt, essays about LeWitt's work, interviews, []. Footnotes are provides across the halves of the book when specific works are referenced.
