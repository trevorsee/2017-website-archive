Publication for MICA's Architectural Design department.
{: .measure-wide }

I worked with Architectural Design department to produce a simple book that they could print themselves on-demand as needed. The book is meant to give current and prospective students an overview of the department, courses, and degree plan. By emphasizing images of student work, the book shows the diversity of project outcomes and the personality of the department.

I designed the book to accommodate changes to the department from year to year, updating courses, descriptions, faculty, and student work. The transparent cover image and title sticker can be swapped out to easily recognize the current issue.
