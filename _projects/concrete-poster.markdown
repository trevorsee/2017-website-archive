What role does material play in the practice of graphic design? The tools we use, often mediated through the computer screen, are removed from the context that the drawing will exist in. The possibilities of design are more shaped by the affordances of Illustrator than the final produced design object. In part, due to the modernist creed that *any* design should be universal.

What if form and material violated the design and made demands on what is possible? How much do the tools we use, our familiarity with those tools, and the expectations put on design artifacts influence what we make. A website designed in the browser or a poster that is "built" is fundamentally different than the design-tool mediated design artifact.
