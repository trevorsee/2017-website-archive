Organization and branding for MICA Design League's fall exhibition.
{: .measure-wide }

Often design artifacts are viewed in isolation away from the larger context or systems in which they were created. *Why* was it was created, *how* decisions were made, *what* are the goals, etc. This method of viewing design does a disservice to both the creator and the viewer where intention and nuance is lost. We were interested in collecting work that is multi-faceted, multi- disciplinary, process-driven, and/or explores a theme or idea in depth.
