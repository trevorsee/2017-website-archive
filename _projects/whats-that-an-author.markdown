A publication and installation exploring machine learning through Calvino's Invisible Cities.

For the content of the books I spliced together the story of Leonia, excerpts from Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, and public domain images from the NYPL. It is printed on found-paper left behind at printers and in recycling bins across campus. (Thanks to [Kristian](http://www.ookb.co/) for letting me steal from his collection). This creates a blurred line between what content "belongs" to the book, what is found from the paper, and the collisions between the two. Who can claim authorship over the final product?

To extend the idea of generated or author-agnostic content, I trained a recurrent neural network on a corpus of Calvino's writing. The output was printed with an Arduino controlled receipt printer as well as displayed as a tiled poster.
